Ember uses models with attributes representing each field. This information is not
provided by the API per-say, it is still provided by the backend though.

Each endpoint's structure is dynamically extracted from its backend serializer and
converted to an Ember model. Each model is served by the backend at
`/models/<endpoint>.js`, if you care to look at a few examples, here are some links:

  - [/models/products/products.js](/models/products/products.js)
  - [/models/products/categories.js](/models/products/categories.js)
  - [/models/crm/companies.js](/models/crm/companies.js)

As you can notice, this isn't very human-readable... But remember we said this was an
**almost** fully dynamic client? We've also statically exported 2 models in order to 
customize them. When statically exporting an Ember model, 3 files are generated:

  - A base file, susceptible to be overwritten and which shouldn't be edited
  - A model file inheriting from the base file (this is where the customization happens).
  - A test file (same as if the model was generated by ember-cli)

On the right, you can see what a statically exported Ember base model looks like, it's
much more readable than the dynamically exported ones.
